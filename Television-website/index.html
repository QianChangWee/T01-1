                <p>Ever since the development of technology into our lives, things been different in a convenient better way. People get to reduce their time and strength spent over the daily tasks like gather information, communication, transportation, house chores and even daily routine 🧐</p>
                <p>So, ever wonder? Now when the whole planet filled with those fancy items, leads to many companies start producing those convenient things into product on marketing. Therefore, the choice will be judged over better quality, shipment, design, functionality, price, friendly-use and etc 🧐</p>
                <p>How about the electricity panel? Something that had combined with our lives now, a part of casualness that people doesn't seems to be strange or surprise until they suddenly broken or not function anymore 🥶 That's when you realized how importance they are, or ... were, since its broken 🥵</p>
                <p>That actually give me a purpose to discuss about something I'm interested,</p>

                <p>For a car of your dream? Oh, you named it. Honda, Toyota, Mercedes, Mitsubishi, Perodua, Ford. To be honest? Its just the brand, not even close to model, and I'm pretty sure you can easily outscore me to name them into list 😏</p>
