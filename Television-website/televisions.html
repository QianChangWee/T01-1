            <h3>Tips for Television purchase and caring</h3>
            <p>Television plays an important role in daily life. It helps people gather information and enjoy entertainment easily.</p>
            
            <section id="purchase">
                <p>Apart from that, wise choices should be considered when purchasing a television for your place, with some tips to be considered:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Consider your <b>screen size</b> based on viewing distance. Bigger isn’t always better if your room is small.</li>
                    <li>Check the <b>screen technology</b> (LCD, LED, OLED) — each has different picture quality, brightness, and energy use.</li>
                    <li>Look at the <b>energy star rating</b>. Higher ratings mean lower long-term electricity costs.</li>
                    <li>Compare <b>brand options</b> — some brands offer more models, others focus on premium features.</li>
                    <li>Don’t ignore <b>power consumption</b>, especially if the TV is large. Bigger screens often use more power.</li>
                </ol>
            </section>

            <section id="caring">
                <p>Besides those considerations, you should also follow these tips to take care of your television to prolong its lifespan:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Avoid leaving the TV on for very long hours unnecessarily — it saves energy and reduces wear.</li>
                    <li>Keep the screen clean with a microfiber cloth, never harsh chemicals.</li>
                    <li>Ensure proper ventilation around the TV to prevent overheating.</li>
                    <li>Use a surge protector to guard against sudden power spikes.</li>
                    <li>Adjust brightness settings — high brightness shortens panel life and consumes more power.</li>
                </ol>
            </section>

            <section id="data_analysis">
                <h4>History of TV</h4>

                <hr>
                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>When choosing a TV, Australian consumers typically prefer mid-to-large LCD models from well-known brands like Samsung and LG.</p>
                <p>Larger TVs tend to use more power, but high star ratings show that efficiency can still be achieved.</p>
                <p>By considering size, technology, energy rating, and brand, buyers can make informed decisions that balance entertainment needs with long-term savings.</p>
